# masterbus

An idiomatic Rust client for the Mastervolt **MasterBus** CAN-bus protocol, with
a terminal UI, a Signal K sidecar, and a C-ABI wrapper. Talks to the bus over
**Linux SocketCAN**, or over the **Mastervolt USB link** (a class-compliant HID
device — no vendor driver) on **Linux, macOS, and Windows**.

A Cargo workspace:

| crate | what |
|-------|------|
| [`masterbus`](crates/masterbus) | core library (the protocol, discovery, caching, subscriptions, the `MasterBus`/`Device`/`Group`/`Field` navigator API and a non-blocking channel API) |
| [`masterbus-tools`](crates/masterbus-tools) | three command-line tools — `masterbus-tui` (terminal UI), `masterbus-signalk` (Signal K sidecar), `masterbus-set-field` (one-shot field writer). `cargo install masterbus-tools` installs all three |
| [`masterbus-ffi`](crates/masterbus-ffi) | C ABI `cdylib` (single-threaded), header generated with cbindgen, plus C demos (not published to crates.io) |

The wire protocol is documented in [`docs/PROTOCOL.md`](docs/PROTOCOL.md).

## Background

For years I've been struggling with the following. After some struggles with
Mastervolt Gel batteries that died way too quickly we did a major refit in 2019
at the boatyard with the electrical system being upgraded. All existing devices
were shipped back to Mastervolt and they signed off on the new setup with
4 x 5000 Wh Lithium batteries. Cost an arm and a leg, but it's been worth it.
Anyway, the customer success engineer that was helping me acknowledged that
programming their MasterBus/NMEA2000 interface was a bit difficult, so he
mentioned a new library that they were testing and was I interested in it? Sure!
They provided me with a "libmasterbus.so/dll" for Linux and Windows. It turned
out to be written in Rust, starting in 2017! Amazing. This library served me well
over the years, but I never received an update.

I tried contacting MasterVolt, but I learned that after their merger into what is
now Brunswick that everyone I knew no longer works there, and I can't get them to
reply to my queries about updates. Since the library was released under an
"Unlicense", e.g. fully open and free, and I really needed an Aarch64 version, I
decided last week that maybe I should just let Claude help me write a new version.
This repository is the fruit of that work.

## Design highlights

- **Fast init**: `connect()` returns as soon as the bus is usable and one device
  is heard — no multi-second enumeration wait, so one-shot tools stay snappy.
- **Lazy, per-menu discovery** with an optional on-disk schema cache (per device,
  keyed by serial) — only the menus you look at are discovered, and long-running
  programs discover each device once and load from cache thereafter.
- **Live values without polling storms**: a passive value cache fed by bus
  traffic, plus rate-based subscriptions that actively poll only what's needed.
- **Two API surfaces over one core**: a blocking navigator API for simple
  one-shots, and a non-blocking channel/event API for the TUI and daemons.

## Building

The core ships two transports: **Linux SocketCAN** (for hosts wired to the bus —
e.g. a Raspberry Pi) and the **Mastervolt USB link** (a class-compliant HID
device — no vendor driver — usable on Linux, macOS, and Windows). SocketCAN is
compiled in only on Linux; the USB transport is built unconditionally.

```sh
cargo build --workspace                 # build everything (host)
cargo test  --workspace                 # unit tests
cargo build --release --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu   # cross-compile for a Pi
```

Or install the three command-line tools (`masterbus-tui`,
`masterbus-signalk`, `masterbus-set-field`) directly:

```sh
cargo install masterbus-tools
```

### Configuration (where the bus is, and whether we drive it)

All tools share a small INI file describing the transport and the optional
"act as bus master" role, so the tools don't need transport arguments on every
invocation. The file is **read on every start** and **auto-created on first
run** with sensible defaults:

| OS | Config path | Default cache dir |
|----|------|------|
| Linux (system) | `/etc/default/masterbus/config.ini` (if writable) | `/var/lib/masterbus` |
| Linux (user) | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/masterbus/config.ini` (default `$HOME/.config/masterbus/config.ini`) | `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/masterbus` (default `$HOME/.cache/masterbus`) |
| macOS | `$HOME/Library/Application Support/masterbus/config.ini` | `$HOME/Library/Caches/masterbus` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\masterbus\config.ini` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\masterbus\cache` |

Auto-detection at creation time prefers a plugged-in **Mastervolt USB link**;
otherwise the **lone CAN interface** (e.g. `can0`) is selected. Multiple CAN
interfaces with no USB link is an error — edit the file and pick one. The path
and detected values are logged to stderr on creation, so a first run isn't
silent.

```ini
# /etc/default/masterbus/config.ini
# 24-bit hex device id we announce as master (class-0x05 heartbeat). Devices
# announce themselves and stay responsive in response; comment out to stay
# passive (a hardware master must drive the bus, e.g. an EasyView panel).
heartbeat_master = 000001

# Transport: "usb" for the Mastervolt USB link, "can" for SocketCAN.
device_type = can

# When device_type = can: interface name. When usb: optional serial number
# (blank = first link found).
device_name = can0

# Where to persist discovered schemas (per device, by serial). Default is
# /var/lib/masterbus for system installs and the OS-native per-user cache
# directory otherwise (see the table above). A non-writable path silently
# falls back to the per-user cache at runtime, so root-owned daemons and
# user-run tools share schemas when possible. Comment out to disable
# on-disk caching.
cache_dir = /var/lib/masterbus
```

To change the heartbeat-master behaviour, swap transports, or relocate the
cache, edit the file (or delete it and let auto-detection re-create it).

### TUI

```sh
masterbus-tui
```

Browse devices on the left; the selected device's tabs are on the right —
`Summary` / `Monitoring` / `Configuration` / `Service` / `Settings`, each
discovered on demand. `Tab` / `Shift-Tab` switch tabs, `Enter` edits a writable
field (booleans toggle, numbers / lists / text open a centred edit modal),
`l` opens the access-level (login) modal — higher levels unlock more fields,
`q` quits.

### Signal K sidecar

`masterbus-signalk` is a long-running service that discovers MasterBus devices and
their monitoring fields, converts supported values to SI units, and publishes
**Signal K deltas** (newline-delimited JSON) over TCP (default `0.0.0.0:3009`).

Discovery and publication are deliberately separate: a discovered field is **not**
published until the user explicitly enables it in
`masterbus-signalk-fields.toml`.

```sh
masterbus-signalk [listen-addr]
# e.g. masterbus-signalk 0.0.0.0:3009
```

On discovery the sidecar creates or updates `masterbus-signalk-fields.toml` in
its working directory. Each field entry records the MasterBus device address,
class, discovered instance/group/name/unit, the mapper's `suggested_path`, the
effective user-editable `path`, and an `enabled` flag. New fields default to:

```toml
enabled = false
```

Users may enable individual fields and override their Signal K paths without
changing the Rust mapper:

```toml
[[fields]]
device = "0x123456"
class = "CHG"
instance = "fwd-charger"
group = "monitoring"
index = "2"
field = "Output 1"
unit = "V"
enabled = true
suggested_path = "electrical.chargers.fwd-charger.voltage"
path = "electrical.chargers.fwdAC.voltage"
```

Existing user choices are preserved across rediscovery because entries are keyed
by stable MasterBus device address + field index. Newly discovered devices and
fields are appended disabled. Fields not yet recognized by the built-in mapper
are still listed, allowing a user to provide a custom path explicitly.

Static device metadata is independently opt-in per device:

```toml
[[devices]]
device = "0x123456"
class = "CHG"
instance = "fwd-charger"
publish_name = true
publish_manufacturer_name = false
publish_model = true
```

When field paths are customized, enabled static metadata follows the effective
user-selected Signal K base path as well, so installation-specific names do not
need to be hard-coded in the mapper.

The sidecar continues to watch for devices that were absent during initial
startup discovery. A newly appearing device is added to the configuration at
runtime. A previously known device that temporarily disappears does not lose its
configuration; when it resumes sending values, its enabled fields can resume
normally.

`masterbus-signalk-fields.toml` is installation-specific runtime configuration
and is intentionally excluded from Git.

For interactive use, `masterbus-signalk-fields.toml` is created in the current
working directory.

For a systemd installation, the supplied unit uses
`/etc/default/masterbus-signalk/` as its working directory, so the field
configuration is stored at:

    /etc/default/masterbus-signalk/masterbus-signalk-fields.toml

MasterBus transport configuration is stored separately at:

    /etc/default/masterbus/config.ini

The service listens on `0.0.0.0:3009` by default. The listen address can be
overridden with `LISTEN` in:

    /etc/default/masterbus-signalk/config

The service binary is installed at `/usr/local/bin/masterbus-signalk` and the
persistent MasterBus schema cache is kept in `/var/lib/masterbus`.

### C library and demos

`masterbus-ffi` builds a `libmasterbus_ffi` C library; `include/masterbus.h` is
generated by cbindgen. The C demos under
[`crates/masterbus-ffi/c`](crates/masterbus-ffi/c) (`mb_enumerate`,
`mb_get_value`, `mb_set_value`) build natively by default, with a `make remote`
target to cross-compile and deploy to a Pi. See that directory's `Makefile`.

## Logging

The library emits via the standard [`log`](https://crates.io/crates/log)
facade — no runtime cost when no logger is initialized. The bundled binaries
install [`env_logger`](https://crates.io/crates/env_logger) and read
`RUST_LOG`:

```sh
RUST_LOG=info masterbus-signalk                # connect / device / discovery
RUST_LOG=masterbus=debug masterbus-set-field … # plus cache, retries, write
RUST_LOG=masterbus::frame=trace …              # per-frame candump-style dump
```

Useful targets: `masterbus::frame` (candump-style Tx/Rx dump),
`masterbus::discovery` (per-menu enumeration, retries), `masterbus::cache`
(schema cache load/save), `masterbus::write` (`do_write` calls),
`masterbus::settings` (config-file creation).

The TUI logs to `masterbus-tui.log` (or `$MASTERBUS_TUI_LOG`) instead of
stderr so its alt-screen stays clean. The `MASTERBUS_LOG` env var that used
to point the engine at a `.log` file is gone — use `RUST_LOG=masterbus::frame=trace`
to get the equivalent dump on stderr (or pipe to a file).

## Status

Works over SocketCAN on Linux and over the Mastervolt USB link on Linux, macOS,
and Windows. The navigator API, FFI demos, TUI, and Signal K sidecar have all
been exercised against a live bus.

## TODO

- [ ] **Alarms tab / event streams** — `Menu::Alarm` and `Menu::History` are
  defined and discoverable, but the TUI tabs for them were removed during the
  channel-aware redesign and not yet restored. The crate also doesn't surface
  alarm broadcasts as events to API consumers.
- [ ] **`masterbus-set-field` Date / Time writes** — currently rejected; not a
  common need but the CLI advertises the omission.
